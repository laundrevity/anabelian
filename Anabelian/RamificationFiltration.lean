# Rung L2, the opening: higher ramification groups in lower numbering (Pass 23)

Mathlib's `RingTheory/Valuation/RamificationGroup.lean` — the setting of Pass 4 — carries a literal
`TODO: Define higher ramification groups in lower numbering`. This file does so (at project level),
on the **corrected architecture** fixed by Pass 22: lower numbering is defined for a valuation
subring `A` of `L/K` and is *non-vacuous exactly when the powers of `𝔪_A` separate* — true at
finite level (DVRs, Krull), provably false for `𝒪[K̄]` (the Pass-22 idempotency). The filtration is
therefore developed *abstractly with the separation hypothesis explicit*, and the hypothesis is
discharged in the Noetherian (= field-or-DVR, the finite-level) case.

## Definitions and results (Serre, *Local Fields*, ch. IV §1; all axiom-free)

For `A : ValuationSubring L` with the `Gal(L/K)`-decomposition-group action of Mathlib's
`RamificationGroup.lean`:

* `Anabelian.ramificationGroup K A i` — **the `i`-th ramification group in lower numbering**:
  `G_i = {σ ∈ decompositionSubgroup | ∀ a ∈ A, σa − a ∈ 𝔪_A^(i+1)}` (`Ideal.inertia` of
  `𝔪_A^(i+1)`, the same device as Pass 21's `galoisInertia`, at the right level). ℕ-indexed with
  `G_0` = inertia; Serre's `G_{−1}` is the ambient decomposition group itself.
* `Anabelian.mem_ramificationGroup_iff` — the defining membership, unfolded.
* `Anabelian.smul_mem_maximalIdeal_pow` — the **crux**: the decomposition action preserves
  `𝔪_A^n` (each `σ` is a ring automorphism of the local `A`, so fixes `𝔪_A` setwise, hence its
  powers — via `Ideal.map_pow` + `map_isMaximal_of_equiv` + local uniqueness).
* `Anabelian.ramificationGroup_antitone` — `G_j ≤ G_i` for `i ≤ j`.
* `Anabelian.ramificationGroup_zero` — **`G_0` is the inertia subgroup**, literally Mathlib's
  `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup` (the kernel of the residue action) — tying the filtration to
  the Pass-4 API via `residue_smul` and the pointwise characterization `mem_inertiaSubgroup_iff`.
* `Anabelian.ramificationGroup_normal` — each `G_i` is **normal in the decomposition group**
  (Serre IV §1 Prop. 1): conjugation transports the inertia condition along
  `smul_mem_maximalIdeal_pow`.
* `Anabelian.iInf_ramificationGroup_eq_bot` — **separation**: if `⨅ n, 𝔪_A^n = ⊥` (Krull
  intersection), then `⨅ i, G_i = ⊥`. A `σ` in every `G_i` fixes `A` pointwise, hence fixes `L`
  (for `l ∉ A`, `l⁻¹ ∈ A` — the valuation-subring dichotomy), hence `σ = 1`.
* `Anabelian.iInf_ramificationGroup_eq_bot_of_isNoetherianRing` — the hypothesis **discharged in
  the Noetherian case** via Mathlib's Krull intersection theorem
  (`Ideal.iInf_pow_eq_bot_of_isLocalRing`). A Noetherian valuation ring is a field or a DVR — this
  is exactly the finite-level (`𝒪_L` for finite `L/K`) case the corrected L2 architecture targets.
* `Anabelian.exists_notMem_ramificationGroup` — the per-element escape: under separation, every
  `σ ≠ 1` leaves some `G_i`.

## Non-vacuity, honestly (the Pass-22 contrast)

The separation hypothesis is stated explicitly because Pass 22 *proved* it fails in the
infinite-level case: for `A`-like `𝒪[K̄]` the maximal ideal is idempotent
(`maximalIdeal_galoisIntegers_sq`), the powers do not separate, and the filtration provably
collapses (`inertia_maximalIdeal_pow_collapse`). The two regimes — collapsing (idempotent `𝔪`,
divisible value group) and separating (DVR, Krull) — are now *both proved*, which is what makes
the hypothesis-parametrized statement the right abstract shape. (No claim is made that the Krull
hypothesis is irremovable from the *conclusion* `⨅ G_i = ⊥` — that would require a constructed
`A` with non-separating powers *and* a nontrivial inertia element, which is not attempted here.)

What this pass does **not** yet provide, logged in `ROADMAP.md` (L2):
* a concrete properly-decreasing chain (`G_0 ≠ G_1` for an explicitly ramified extension) — the
  come-apart exhibit that the definition eventually deserves;
* ~~eventual triviality `∃ i, G_i = ⊥` for finite decomposition groups~~ — **DONE, Pass 24**
  (`exists_ramificationGroup_eq_bot` below);
* the tame quotient `G_0/G_1 ↪ 𝓀^×` (the hom + kernel half is **Pass 24**,
  `Anabelian/TameCharacter.lean`; injectivity remains), wild `G_1` pro-`p`, Herbrand `φ`/`ψ`,
  upper numbering;
* the local-field instantiation `A = 𝒪_L`, `L/K` finite — blocked on the (verified absent)
  finite-extension `IsNonarchimedeanLocalField` instances.

**Not reconstruction.** Structure of the Galois action of given fields; no reach toward R1–R3.

## Axiom status

Standard axioms only on every declaration (`#print axioms` below). Ledger: `0 FOUNDATIONAL /
0 DEBT`, unchanged. No new `structure`/`class` (the filtration is a `Subgroup`-valued `def`).
D1 N/A; D2 N/A (no spectral structure; the file is `ValuationSubring`-native).
