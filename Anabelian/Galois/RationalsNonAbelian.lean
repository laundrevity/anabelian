# Discharging owed witness W1: the absolute Galois group of ℚ is non-commutative

This file discharges **W1** (`AXIOM_LEDGER.md`), the load-bearing-hypothesis witness owed since
Pass 1: it proves a *concrete* field — ℚ — whose absolute Galois group is **non-commutative**, hence
non-procyclic. This shows `[Finite F]` is genuinely load-bearing for the Pass-1/Pass-2
finite-field lemmas (`Anabelian.absoluteGaloisGroup_mul_comm`,
`Anabelian.frobenius_topologicalClosure_eq_top`): those would be **false** for the non-finite ℚ.

## What is proved

`Anabelian.rationals_absoluteGaloisGroup_not_commutative`:
`¬ ∀ σ τ : Field.absoluteGaloisGroup ℚ, σ * τ = τ * σ`.

Proof: the splitting field of `X³ - 2` over ℚ has Galois group `≅ S₃` (non-abelian), via Mathlib's
`Gal.galActionHom_bijective_of_prime_degree'` (an irreducible prime-degree rational polynomial with
the right real/complex root count has full symmetric Galois group). The absolute Galois group
surjects onto it (`Gal.restrict_surjective`), and a surjection onto a non-abelian group is
non-abelian.

## Why this is genuine content — and what it is NOT

It is the **discharge of a tracked debt of rigor**: Passes 1–2 *claimed* `[Finite F]` was essential
but only registered the witness (W1). This proves it. It is **not** reconstruction: the statement is
a property of the Galois action on the *given* field ℚ (and its given algebraic closure); nothing is
recovered from an abstract topological group. It introduces no new load-bearing hypothesis of its
own (it *is* the counterexample witness), and no new `structure`/`class`.

## A note on the ℚ-algebra diamond

The proof locally disables the instance `DivisionRing.toRatAlgebra`. Without this, instance
resolution gives `Algebra ℚ (AlgebraicClosure ℚ)` via the generic "every characteristic-0 division
ring is a ℚ-algebra" route rather than `AlgebraicClosure.instAlgebra`, and the two do not match at
the reducibility used by instance search — so `Normal ℚ (AlgebraicClosure ℚ)` (needed by
`restrict_surjective`) fails to synthesize. Disabling the generic instance for this declaration
makes every `Algebra ℚ (AlgebraicClosure ℚ)` use the algebraic-closure structure consistently (the
same one baked into `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup ℚ`), and the proof goes through. This was found by
probe (see this pass's `NOTES.md`); the `ℂ`-side (`Algebra ℚ ℂ`) is unaffected, as ℂ carries its own
ℚ-algebra instance.

## Axiom status

Standard axioms only (`#print axioms` below). Pass-3 ledger delta: **0 DEBT / 0 FOUNDATIONAL**;
Owed witnesses: **W1 discharged**.
